# 🎯 Project Overview

🤗 This repository is a fork of lerobot by XenseRobotics, used for Xense's multimodal tactile data acquisition system. It implements numerous new features compared to the original repository.

## 🔧 Installation

This repository is tested on Ubuntu 22.04, NVIDIA Unix Driver Archive >= 570.144. We strongly recommend using [`Mamba`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install) to manage your conda environments. You can also use conda, but it will take significantly longer. Due to the xensesdk dependencies, lerobot-xense works only with python 3.10 and pytorch 2.7.1+ with cuda-12.8 right now.

```bash
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

### 📦 Environment Setup

**Step 1:** 📥 Download and install the XenseVR PC Service `.deb` package from [XenseVR-PC-Service v0.1.0 Release](https://github.com/Vertax42/XenseVR-PC-Service/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

> ⚠️ **Note:** This package has only been tested on **x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04**. Other architectures or distributions may not work right now.

```bash
# After downloading the .deb file, install it with:
sudo dpkg -i xensevr-pc-service_*.deb
# or simply run:
sudo apt-get install ./xensevr-pc-service_*.deb
```

**Step 2:** 🐭 Install HID API for 3D SpaceMouse support:

```bash
# Install hidapi library for SpaceMouse devices
sudo apt-get install libhidapi-dev
```

**Step 3:** 📂 Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vertax42/lerobot-xense.git
cd lerobot-xense
```

**Step 4:** 🐍 Create and activate the conda/mamba environment, then install dependencies:

```bash
bash ./setup_env.sh --mamba <optional_env_name>
mamba activate <optional_env_name> # or conda activate <optional_env_name>
bash ./setup_env.sh --install # you need to enter password for sudo access to install the dependencies
```

**Step 5:** 📌 Check if FFmpeg 7.X is installed in your environment and `libsvtav1` encoder is supported:

```bash
mamba list | grep ffmpeg
ffmpeg -encoders | grep libsvtav1
```

```

### Dual Device Configuration

Perfect for complex robotic tasks requiring precise position and orientation control:

```python

## 📊 Weights & Biases

To use Weights and Biases for experiment tracking, log in with:

```bash
wandb login
```

**Note:** You will also need to enable WandB in the configuration. See below.

## 👀 Visualize datasets

Check out [example 1](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/dataset/load_lerobot_dataset.py) that illustrates how to use our dataset class which automatically downloads data from the Hugging Face hub.

You can also locally visualize episodes from a dataset on the hub by executing our script from the command line:

```bash
lerobot-dataset-viz \
    --repo-id lerobot/pusht \
    --episode-index 0
```

or from a dataset in a local folder with the `root` option and the `--mode local` (in the following case the dataset will be searched for in `./my_local_data_dir/lerobot/pusht`)

```bash
lerobot-dataset-viz \
    --repo-id lerobot/pusht \
    --root ./my_local_data_dir \
    --mode local \
    --episode-index 0
```

Our script can also visualize datasets stored on a distant server. See `lerobot-dataset-viz --help` for more instructions.

## 🔑 The `LeRobotDataset` format

A dataset in `LeRobotDataset` format is very simple to use. It can be loaded from a repository on the Hugging Face hub or a local folder simply with e.g. `dataset = LeRobotDataset("lerobot/aloha_static_coffee")` and can be indexed into like any Hugging Face and PyTorch dataset. For instance `dataset[0]` will retrieve a single temporal frame from the dataset containing observation(s) and an action as PyTorch tensors ready to be fed to a model.

A specificity of `LeRobotDataset` is that, rather than retrieving a single frame by its index, we can retrieve several frames based on their temporal relationship with the indexed frame, by setting `delta_timestamps` to a list of relative times with respect to the indexed frame. For example, with `delta_timestamps = {"observation.image": [-1, -0.5, -0.2, 0]}` one can retrieve, for a given index, 4 frames: 3 "previous" frames 1 second, 0.5 seconds, and 0.2 seconds before the indexed frame, and the indexed frame itself (corresponding to the 0 entry). See example [1_load_lerobot_dataset.py](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/dataset/load_lerobot_dataset.py) for more details on `delta_timestamps`.

Under the hood, the `LeRobotDataset` format makes use of several ways to serialize data which can be useful to understand if you plan to work more closely with this format. We tried to make a flexible yet simple dataset format that would cover most type of features and specificities present in reinforcement learning and robotics, in simulation and in real-world, with a focus on cameras and robot states but easily extended to other types of sensory inputs as long as they can be represented by a tensor.

Here are the important details and internal structure organization of a typical `LeRobotDataset` instantiated with `dataset = LeRobotDataset("lerobot/aloha_static_coffee")`. The exact features will change from dataset to dataset but not the main aspects:

```
dataset attributes:
  ├ hf_dataset: a Hugging Face dataset (backed by Arrow/parquet). Typical features example:
  │  ├ observation.images.cam_high (VideoFrame):
  │  │   VideoFrame = {'path': path to a mp4 video, 'timestamp' (float32): timestamp in the video}
  │  ├ observation.state (list of float32): position of an arm joints (for instance)
  │  ... (more observations)
  │  ├ action (list of float32): goal position of an arm joints (for instance)
  │  ├ episode_index (int64): index of the episode for this sample
  │  ├ frame_index (int64): index of the frame for this sample in the episode ; starts at 0 for each episode
  │  ├ timestamp (float32): timestamp in the episode
  │  ├ next.done (bool): indicates the end of an episode ; True for the last frame in each episode
  │  └ index (int64): general index in the whole dataset
  ├ meta: a LeRobotDatasetMetadata object containing:
  │  ├ info: a dictionary of metadata on the dataset
  │  │  ├ codebase_version (str): this is to keep track of the codebase version the dataset was created with
  │  │  ├ fps (int): frame per second the dataset is recorded/synchronized to
  │  │  ├ features (dict): all features contained in the dataset with their shapes and types
  │  │  ├ total_episodes (int): total number of episodes in the dataset
  │  │  ├ total_frames (int): total number of frames in the dataset
  │  │  ├ robot_type (str): robot type used for recording
  │  │  ├ data_path (str): formattable string for the parquet files
  │  │  └ video_path (str): formattable string for the video files (if using videos)
  │  ├ episodes: a DataFrame containing episode metadata with columns:
  │  │  ├ episode_index (int): index of the episode
  │  │  ├ tasks (list): list of tasks for this episode
  │  │  ├ length (int): number of frames in this episode
  │  │  ├ dataset_from_index (int): start index of this episode in the dataset
  │  │  └ dataset_to_index (int): end index of this episode in the dataset
  │  ├ stats: a dictionary of statistics (max, mean, min, std) for each feature in the dataset, for instance
  │  │  ├ observation.images.front_cam: {'max': tensor with same number of dimensions (e.g. `(c, 1, 1)` for images, `(c,)` for states), etc.}
  │  │  └ ...
  │  └ tasks: a DataFrame containing task information with task names as index and task_index as values
  ├ root (Path): local directory where the dataset is stored
  ├ image_transforms (Callable): optional image transformations to apply to visual modalities
  └ delta_timestamps (dict): optional delta timestamps for temporal queries
```

A `LeRobotDataset` is serialised using several widespread file formats for each of its parts, namely:

- hf_dataset stored using Hugging Face datasets library serialization to parquet
- videos are stored in mp4 format to save space
- metadata are stored in plain json/jsonl files

Dataset can be uploaded/downloaded from the HuggingFace hub seamlessly. To work on a local dataset, you can specify its location with the `root` argument if it's not in the default `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot` location.
