    """Configuration for Pico4 VR teleoperator.

    This teleoperator provides 6-DoF absolute pose control using VR controllers,
    suitable for end-effector teleoperation. The output is an accumulated target_pose_6d
    that can be directly sent to a Cartesian controller.

    Attributes:
        use_left_controller: Whether to use the left controller for teleoperation.
        use_right_controller: Whether to use the right controller for teleoperation.
        pos_sensitivity: Sensitivity multiplier for position control (scales delta position).
                         1.0 = 1:1 mapping, 0.5 = half speed.
        ori_sensitivity: Sensitivity multiplier for orientation control.
                         1.0 = full tracking, 0.5 = half speed rotation.
        filter_window_size: Moving average filter window size for smoothing pose changes.
        gripper_width: Maximum gripper position in meters (for clamping).
        grip_threshold: Threshold value (0-1) for grip to be considered pressed (enable control).
        orientation_offset_warning_deg: Warning threshold in degrees for orientation offset at enable.
                                        If controller-robot orientation difference exceeds this,
                                        a warning is logged and orientation control is disabled.
        target_tcp_drift_max_deg: Max allowed angle between Python's last commanded _target_quat
                                  and the actual TCP quaternion at grip-press. Above this, REF_RESET
                                  is aborted and _target_quat is resynced to the actual TCP, so the
                                  next frame sends a no-op. Kept below Flexiv's 90° safety limit
                                  (301005 fault) to leave headroom for RT tracking error and filter
                                  delay. Only active when the caller passes live TCP into get_action().
