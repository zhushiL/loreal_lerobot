    Logs observation and action data to Rerun for real-time visualization.

    This function iterates through the provided observation and action dictionaries and sends their contents
    to the Rerun viewer. It handles different data types appropriately:
    - Scalars values (floats, ints) are logged as `rr.Scalars`.
    - 3D NumPy arrays that resemble images (e.g., with 1, 3, or 4 channels first) are transposed
      from CHW to HWC format and logged as `rr.Image`.
    - 1D NumPy arrays are logged as a series of individual scalars, with each element indexed.
    - Other multi-dimensional arrays are flattened and logged as individual scalars.

    Keys are automatically namespaced with "observation." or "action." if not already present.

        observation: An optional dictionary containing observation data to log.
        action: An optional dictionary containing action data to log.
